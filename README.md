# Monte Carlo Simulation of Airline Overbooking

I recently read a simple and interesting blog post by Mira Khare, Melanie Huynh, Arni Sturluson, Cory Simon, Link : https://simonensemble.github.io/operations%20research/2018/07/24/airline-overbooking/

As i have been polishing my python skills, I thought it would be a good idea to code the same in python.

As the blog post mentions, Airlines operate on razor thin margins, it is imperative that they maximise their profits as much as possible. Since, there is always a chance, that 100% of the customers do not turn up for their flights, Airlines overbook their planes, so as to maximise the profits they can make. 
so, the challenge is to identify how many tickets should an airline overbook, in order to maximise their profits. 

This code can be used to identify the optimal tickets to overbook to maximise the profits based on the costs involved if a customer has to be turned back on account of overselling.
