# Monte Carlo Simulation of Airline Overbooking

Authors of the post, presented a way to optimise the no of tickets an airline should oversell to maximise their profits. They wrote the code in Julia, As i have been polishing my python skills, I thought it would be a good idea to code the same in python.

Airline business is a cut throat business, its one of those business where your supply side is limited (only 2 major aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing) and so is the client side (finite no of regular flying customers) plus you have rising fuel costs and stiff competition within the industry. The only differentiator for any airline operator from their competitor is the customer service that is provided by them to attract more customers from the finite pool.

When airlines operate a flight on a route, they incur a fixed cost to oeprate the flight, and the only way they achieve maximum profit is when they manage to fully book the flight. But as we all know that there are always certain %ge of people who cancel their flights last minute, or do not show up for their flights. In scenario like this airline is loosing a certain percentage of profits ( or a chance of booking more profits in cases of no shows by the customer) when they fly with empty seats.
